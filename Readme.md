**Arduino Powered AutoCar Complete List**

The following repositiory will display the complete package for the AutoCar powered by Arduino

Here all the features will be descripted with ample description on what to add and how to configure

1. Driving:
    This should support manual driving, supported by IR Remote as well as a Bluetooth application. This application must be supporting Android and later iOS (Beta)

2. Autopilot (SafePark™)
    This feature must be installed in vehicles as a stable release, but it must be improved for later use and added benifits. Partnership will be with SafePark, and features listed below will be added to improve users and vehicles' functions
 2.1 Cruise
    This feature ensure the vehicle remains at a stedy speed at long roads, when the speed is alter very frequently, cruise feature will turn off and Autopilot will turn on. These features can be toggled by the IR Remote, Bluetooth application or automatically by the Autopilot.
 2.2 Safepark™ Adaptive cruise
    This program instills the adaptive cruise feature present on many vehicles today. The cruise feature will be toggled and the adaptive cruise feature will be automatically be activated in order to protect from any incidents. When an objects' distance will decrease from a specific value in the front or back of the vehicle, the car will alter its speed in order to compensate for the lost distance.

3. Parking (SafePark™)
    This feature will be installed as partly stable, while the parallel version will be installed as (Beta). The normal (perpendicular) parking will be released as a stable version, while (parallel) parking will be released as (Beta), and later refined via the AI Traffic Technology implemented in the future, also with the collaboration with SafePark™

4. Automatic Lighting
    This feature consists of the lighting being automatically toggled during the conditions of the environment. An alternative is also going to be included that consists of it being toggled via the IR Remote and Bluetooth™ application.

5. AI Assisted Traffic Learning
    This feature will be least developed in the initial release of the project. It will continously demand inputs and values from the onboard sensors. The data will then be used to plot points and find frequencies that will make the autopilot analyse the traffic routines. This will lead to the autopilot adapt and respond to the changes with beter efficiency
